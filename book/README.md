## 1.2. Hello, World!

2 steps to running a program written in Rust: 

1. compiling the source code.
2. running the resulting executable file.

`rustc` is the rust compiler.

```
rustc main.rs
./main
```

## 1.3. Hello, Cargo!

Build the executable file with `cargo build`.
That will compile (starting at `src/main.rs`) into `target/debug/<name>`,
where `<name>` is whatever is in the `name` field of `cargo.toml`.

Running the file takes 2 step
- Building an executable: `cargo build`
- Running the executable: `./target/debug/<name>`

That can be done in 1 step:
`cargo run`

In both cases, the executable file will be unoptimized and contain debugging info.

Unoptimized because **the compiler is slow**.
To build an executable with optimizations, add the `--release` flag.
`cargo build --release`.
Cargo will put the resulting executable in `target/release` instead of `target/debug`.

`cargo check` to run the checks the compiler would, while not producing an executable.
This is much faster.

## 3.1. Variables and Mutability

Declare a variable with the `let` keyword.
`let x = 5`

Variables are immutable by default.

**The compiler is fussy. [This is a good thing.](https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/blog/love-errors)**

The compiler checks for a lot of issues that can cause bugs and unwanted behaviour.

> In Rust, the compiler guarantees that when you state that a value won’t change, it really won’t change.

Use the `mut` keyword in front of the variable name to make it mutable.
`let mut x = 5;`

### Differences Between Variables and Constants

Declare constants with the `const` keyword.

_If variables are immutable by default, what's the difference between variables and constants?_

You aren't allowed to use `mut` on constants. No mutating, ever.

The type of the value _must_ be declared.
In a variable declaration, you _may_, in a constant declaration, you _must_.

Constants can only be set to a constant expression, _not_ the result of a function call or anything that could only be determined at runtime.

The naming convention for `const` is `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
The naming convention for `let` is `snake_case`.

You can add underscores in the middle of numbers to help with readability, they won't affect the type.

`const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;`
is the same thing as
`const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100000;`

### Shadowing

You can _declare_ a new variable with the same name as a variable that already exists.

_Why would I not just make that variable mutable instead?_

By redeclaring the variable, you can change the type of the variable.
A mutable variable can not change type. A new variable can have any and all types.
That new variable can just so happen to have the same name.

```rust
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

The first declaration of `spaces` is a string type.
The second declaration, which is a brand new variable, has a number type.
