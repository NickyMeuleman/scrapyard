## 1. Getting Started

## 1.2. Hello, World!

2 steps to running a program written in Rust:

1. compiling the source code.
2. running the resulting executable file.

`rustc` is the rust compiler.

```
rustc main.rs
./main
```

## 1.3. Hello, Cargo!

Build the executable file with `cargo build`.
That will compile (starting at `src/main.rs`) into `target/debug/<name>`,
where `<name>` is whatever is in the `name` field of `cargo.toml`.

Running the file takes 2 step

- Building an executable: `cargo build`
- Running the executable: `./target/debug/<name>`

That can be done in 1 step:
`cargo run`

In both cases, the executable file will be unoptimized and contain debugging info.

Unoptimized because **the compiler is slow**.
To build an executable with optimizations, add the `--release` flag.
`cargo build --release`.
Cargo will put the resulting executable in `target/release` instead of `target/debug`.

`cargo check` to run the checks the compiler would, while not producing an executable.
This is much faster.

## 3. Common Programming Concepts

## 3.1. Variables and Mutability

Declare a variable with the `let` keyword.
`let x = 5`

Variables are immutable by default.

**The compiler is fussy. [This is a good thing.](https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/blog/love-errors)**

The compiler checks for a lot of issues that can cause bugs and unwanted behaviour.

> In Rust, the compiler guarantees that when you state that a value wonâ€™t change, it really wonâ€™t change.

Use the `mut` keyword in front of the variable name to make it mutable.
`let mut x = 5;`

### Differences Between Variables and Constants

Declare constants with the `const` keyword.

_If variables are immutable by default, what's the difference between variables and constants?_

You aren't allowed to use `mut` on constants. No mutating, ever.

The type of the value _must_ be declared.
In a variable declaration, you _may_, in a constant declaration, you _must_.

Constants can only be set to a constant expression, _not_ the result of a function call or anything that could only be determined at runtime.

The naming convention for `const` is `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
The naming convention for `let` is `snake_case`.

You can add underscores in the middle of numbers to help with readability, they won't affect the type.

`const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;`
is the same thing as
`const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100000;`

### Shadowing

You can _declare_ a new variable with the same name as a variable that already exists.

_Why would I not just make that variable mutable instead?_

By redeclaring the variable, you can change the type of the variable.
A mutable variable can not change type. A new variable can have any and all types.
That new variable can just so happen to have the same name.

```rust
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

The first declaration of `spaces` is a string type.
The second declaration, which is a brand new variable, has a number type.

## 3.2. Data Types

> Every value in Rust is of a certain data type

When Rust compiles, it needs to know the types of all variables.
It can infer a bunch of those types, if not, declare them explicitly.

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

If that `u32` is left off, the compiler will complain and suggest you add a type annotation.

### Sidebranch: understanding that code snippet

The code they used here confuses me. I want to know what it does, off to the docs!
Specifically, what do those 2 methods do?

`"42"` is a string type. The method `parse()` gets called on it.

https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html#method.parse
This parses the string into another type, in this case, a number. More specifically, a `u32`.

The docs say:

> Because parse is so general, it can cause problems with type inference. As such, parse is one of the few times you'll see the syntax affectionately known as the 'turbofish': ::<>. This helps the inference algorithm understand specifically which type you're trying to parse into.

I don't understand half of that at this point so this is my takeaway:
We want to parse the string 42 into the number 42.
We call `.parse()` on `"42"`.
But because `.parse()` is so general, the compiler doesn't know which type that string turned into.
We do, because huumans smort.
`.parse()` returns something called `Result`.
What that does, I don't know yet.
What I do know is I can find the right documentation for the `.expect()` function called on it.

https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect
The docs say:

> Returns the contained Ok value, consuming the self value.

That "self value", while I don't know exactly.
I assume that in this case it refers to the thing the `.expect()` function is called on. So, `"42"`.
A bit like `this` in JavaScript.

Alright, I have no idea what this `Ok` is here.
Time to look at what that `Result` is first.

https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/result/enum.Result.html
The docs say:

> Result is a type that represents either success (Ok) or failure (Err).

So if there are no errors, `Ok` contains the resulting value.
If there was an error, `Err` contains the resulting error.

The docs for `expect()` makes more sense now.

> Returns the contained Ok value, consuming the self value.

On that same page:

> Panics if the value is an Err, with a panic message including the passed message, and the content of the Err.

So the string that was entered in the code example will be shown in an error message when the code panics.

My next question: _what does panic mean?_
Rust panicks when an unexpected error happens, when nothing handles that error.
Rust immediately exits and shows an error message.

To recap:

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

The `parse` function is called on `"42"`.
It returns a `Result` that contains either the successful result of the operation, or an error.
The `except` function is called on that `Result`.
It returns either that successful result, or it panics.
If it panicks, it will display the error from the `Result` in the console and it will add whatever was passed to `expect`.
In this case `"Not a number!"` will be shown if that code panics.

Back to the regularly scheduled Rust book.

### Scalar types

Scalar types represent a single value.
Rust has four of those _integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters_.

#### integers

Integers are whole numbers.
There are 2 types of integers, signed ones and unsigned ones.
Signed ones can be negative (they include a sign, hence, signed).
Unsigned ones don't include a sign and are assumed to be positive.

| Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
| arch    | isize  | usize    |

The numbers are how many bits are used to store the number and directly affect how large the stored numbers can be.
For example: a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 255 (in decimal notation).
Under the hood. The signed numbers are stored using [two's complements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).

`isize` and `usize` are whoever many bytes correspond to your type of computer.
64 for 64bit architecture or 32 for 32bit architecture.

| Number literals | Example     |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Decimal         | 98_222      |
| Hex             | 0xff        |
| Octal           | 0o77        |
| Binary          | 0b1111_0000 |
| Byte(u8 only)   | b'A'        |

Repeating from earlier: numbers can have a `_` in them to improve readability.
Decimal numbers are not prefixed.
Hex numbers are prefixed with `0x`.
Octal numbers are prefixed with `0o`.
Binary numbers are prefixed with `0b`.

A note on overflow:
Integer overflow will cause a program to panic.
When building with `--release`, those checks won't happen and two's complement wrapping occurs instead.
If you rely on it, you should do so explicity. By using [`Wrapping`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.Wrapping.html).

#### Floating-point

Floating point numbers are numbers with a decimal point in them.

2 types: `f32` and `f64`.
`f32` is single precision. `f64` has double precision.
The default is `f64`.

#### Numeric Operations

The usual suspects exist for math operators in Rust, and they behave as expected.

| Operator | Operation      |
| -------- | -------------- |
| `+`      | addition       |
| `-`      | subtraction    |
| `*`      | multiplication |
| `/`      | division       |
| `%`      | remainder      |

#### Boolean Type

The `bool` type is a datatype which can be either `true` or `false`.
The boolean type uses one byte of memory.

#### The Character Type

A value with the `char` type holds a [Unicode scalar value](http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value).
The `char` type is four bytes in size.

A `char` is specified with single quotes `'`.
Strings are specified with double quotes `"`.

Not only ASCII can be represented, more complex characters too.
Emojis are unicode, they fit.

```rust
let c = 'z';
let z = 'â„¤';
let face = '\u{1F600}';
// is the same as
let face = 'ðŸ˜€';
```

### Compound types

Compound types group multiple values into one type.
Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

#### Tuple

A tuple is a grouping of multiple values.
A tuple has a fixed length.
A tuple can be made up out of multiple different types. (a type made out of types? Whaaaa, yo dawg /xzibit)

The syntax is: a comma seperated list inside parentheses.

```rust
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
```

`tup` contains the entire tuple.
It has a length of 3.
That tuple consists of an `i32`, an `f64`, and a `u8`.

The values inside a tuple can be destructured using pattern matching.

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
    let (x, y, z) = tup;
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
    println!("The value of tup is: {:?}", tup);
}
```

Gets the first, second, and third value out of the tuple.
Those values are assigned to the variable names `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Doing this does not destroy the tuple, you can still access it afterwards.
Nevermind that `:?` there, that's a way to get tuples to print to the console.
This book will cover that later, I'm sure.

Accessing things in a tuple doesn't have to be done that way.
You can access what's inside a tuple via the index it's located at.

Syntax: `tuple.index`

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```

#### Array

An array is a grouping of multiple values.
An array has a fixed length.
An array can only contain values of a single type.

Those first two are the same as a tuple.

The syntax is: a comma seperated list inside square brackets.

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

The data is allocated on the stack, not the heap.
(I wouldn't have understood this if I didn't watch [Frederico Terzi's course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdx6KsjYhO8&list=PLcVYa6NNTe2PaUV1eMH9Di8WpqdhOTTIw)).
TL;DW: It's stored in a different way, at a different location in memory.

If you're looking for the array you know from other programming languages, one that can change size, that's a vector.
When unsure about whether to choose array or vector. Go with vector.

Syntax for the type annotation: `[type;amount]` where the amount is the length of the array.

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

You can use a similar syntax to the _type_ annotation to initialize a _value_.

```rust
let a = [3; 5];
// same as
let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];
```

Will initialize an array that's of length 5 and every item in it will be `3`.

The values inside an array can be destructured using pattern matching.

```rust
fn main() {
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let [v, w, x, y, z] = arr;
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
    println!("The value of arr is: {:?}", arr);
}
```

Accessing things in an array doesn't have to be done that way.
You can access what's inside an array via the index it's located at.

Syntax: `array[index]`

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```

Trying to access an invalid element

```rust
// This code will panic
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let index = 10;
    let element = a[index];
    println!("The value of element is: {}", element);
}
```

This code will compile, but will panic at runtime when it comes across the attempted access of the element at index 10.
The compiler knows `index` is an integer.
But it doesn't keep track of which integer.
Thus it doesn't know the value held inside (`10`) is out of bounds for the array.
If we tried to access the array at index `10` by passing the `10` directly.
Rust would know and the code would not compile.

```rust
// This code will not compile
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let element = a[10];
    println!("The value of element is: {}", element);
}
```
