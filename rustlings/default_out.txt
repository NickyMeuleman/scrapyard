Thanks for installing Rustlings!

Is this your first time?

Let's make sure you're up to speed:
- You have Rust installed, preferably via `rustup`
- You have `~/.cargo/bin` added to your PATH variable
- You have cloned this repository (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- You have installed Rust language support for your editor
- You have locally installed the `rustlings` command by running an
  installation script or manually executing:

cargo install --force --path .

If you've done all of this (or even most of it), congrats! You're ready
to start working with Rust.

To get started, run `rustlings watch` in order to get the first exercise.
Make sure to have your editor open!
